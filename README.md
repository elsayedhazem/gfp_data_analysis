### About the 2023 GFP Dataset

Based on publicly available data scraped from the [Global Firepower (GFP) website](https://www.globalfirepower.com/), our dataset provides a detailed ranking of military capabilities across 145 countries. Widely referenced in online articles on public perception of military capability, it includes data on defense budgets, personnel numbers (active, reserve, and paramilitary), and equipment inventories like tanks, aircraft, and naval vessels. Additionally, the dataset covers infrastructure aspects such as transportation networks and geographic information. Economic indicators such as Purchasing Power Parity (PPP), oil production and consumption, and external debt are also featured, offering a broader view of each nation's military capacity and preparedness. Based on the website's description, this data aims to aid understanding the balance of power globally. A description of the 58 features in the dataset can be found in the [GFP 2023 Military Dataset Breakdown](https://github.com/elsayedhazem/gfp_data_analysis/blob/main/GFP%20Military%20Dataset%20Breakdown.pdf)
